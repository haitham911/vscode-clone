## Introduction

VSCode Clone is a desktop application that mimics some features of Visual Studio Code. It is built using Electron, React, and other supporting libraries. This project demonstrates how to build a cross-platform desktop application using modern web technologies.

## Features

- File Explorer: Select and view folders from your disk.
- Text Editor: View and edit text files.
- Customizable workspace.
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vscode-clone.git
cd vscode-clone
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

To start the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will build the project using Webpack and start the Electron application.

## Building for Different Platforms

### Building for Windows

To build the application for Windows:

```bash
npm run dist -- --win
```

### Building for macOS

To build the application for macOS, you need to use a macOS environment. If you are using a CI/CD service like GitHub Actions, you can configure it to build for macOS.

#### GitHub Actions Example

Create a workflow file in `.github/workflows/build.yml`:

```yaml
name: Build Electron App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build app
        run: npm run build

      - name: Package app
        run: npx electron-builder --mac
        env:
          CSC_LINK: ${{ secrets.CSC_LINK }}
          CSC_KEY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.CSC_KEY_PASSWORD }}
```

### Building for Linux

To build the application for Linux:

```bash
npm run dist -- --linux
```
